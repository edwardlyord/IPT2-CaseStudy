          <p>
            "Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online through browsers. 
            It involves a range of tasks, from designing simple static pages to complex web-based applications, e-commerce platforms, and social networking services. 
            Web development is typically divided into two main areas: front-end development, which focuses on the visual aspects of a website that users interact with, 
            and back-end development, which involves server-side programming, databases, and application logic.
